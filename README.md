# Semantic Change of Words over time
The goal of this project was to come up with an efficient framework for tracking the semantic change of words over time.

Semantic change refers to change in themeaning of the word to a point that current meaning of the word is fundamentally different from the original usage. Meanings of the words are subject to constant change with time. For example, in earlier days the word plane was used to refer the geometric figure whereas it is now being used to refer to an aircraft. There are also a certain set of words which acquire
additional meanings and are used to refer to other entities over time.

We have implemented and extensively experimented with state of the art alogrithms such as Word2Vec, GloVe and Topic Modelling methods such as Latent Dirchlet Allocation, Latent Semantic Analysis and Hierarical Dirchelet Process for solving the problem of semantic change. We used State of Union Speeches dataset for our analysis.
